wrap Cascade Detector training by OpenCV in GUI

* I have just started learning PyQt4, decided to wrap the OpenCV Cascade classifier for object detection, which is a bit hairy to use before. 

### basic features

* using PASCAL VOC style annotation (labelImg)
* support merging datasets (conbine two sets of /pos /neg /Anno)
* support simple test

### goal

* the plan is to connect the Cascade classifier into ROS
